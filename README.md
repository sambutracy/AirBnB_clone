## What is HBnB Command Line Interface (CLI)?
### Description
This collaborative project is an integral component of the ALX Software Engineering program. It marks the initial phase in the development of our inaugural full-fledged web application: a replica of AirBnB. In this initial phase, we're crafting a personalized command-line interface for handling data, along with the foundational classes required for storing this data.

HBnB CLI refers to a Command Line Interface (CLI) for manipulating data in an Airbnb clone without using a visual interface. This means it's a text-based interface where users interact with the application by typing commands into a terminal or command prompt.

## How to use the Command Interpreter?
### Usage


The console operates in both interactive and non-interactive modes, such as that of a Unix shell. It displays a prompt (hbnb) and awaits user input.
